# A Web Development Quiz by Alan Lee


## Description

This functional web development quiz is both a useful study tool as well as a genuine test of my current Javascript skill. This website has been created nearly to completion with javascript. The html file has been left relatively blank and the css file used only to reset the default settings to the browser. Everything that you see on screen is contained within the javascript file. 


This current version of my website quiz features several things:

1). Allows for the user to choose their preferred study method, whether that be fill in the blank or with multiple choice.

2). The web page is responsive with both it's buttons, it's key actions, as well as it's built in timer that keeps track of student progress. Had I more time I would expound on the style and functionality of the timer.

3). The webpage can store the scores and the initials of the user on their local machine for repeated use AND allows for the user to reset their scores in the event they wish too.

This website can be modified with simple additions to the questionaire script. By inputing new questions and answers in an easily readable fashion, the quiz can be expounded on by anyone and rapidly utilized. This is a great study tool.

Through the process of creating this web development quiz I have learned several things:

1). Developing a website with only javascript is more challenging than it would seem, especially because the entire framework must be coded in as variables. In the future, I will definitely prefer to set up ALL the static elements in HTML and in CSS rather than javascript.

2). That said, javascript is insanely powerful when it comes to dynamic elements. There can be no question that generating new elements, especially lists, is much easier to do in javascript.

3). There almost always is a simpler, better way of doing just about anything. Documentation is a necessity.
